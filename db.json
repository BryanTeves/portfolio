      "description": "This was my first React project. When I finished my course, I realized that React is so GREAT to work with. With that in mind, I mixed up one of my passions with another of my passions, games and program, so I thought \"Why not make a League of legends wiki?\", and it's how this project came alive. The main concept of the league-wiki is to bring all the infos of some champion. I used React, Sass and the RIOT API to bring this project out of paper",
